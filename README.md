# SmartEmailAssistant

SmartEmailAssistant is an AI-powered Gmail extension that helps users generate intelligent, context-aware email replies with just one click. It integrates directly into Gmail’s reply interface and uses Artificial Intelligence to understand the email content and generate a response based on the selected tone.

# Project Overview

Writing emails can be time-consuming, repetitive, and mentally draining—especially when responding to professional or formal messages. SmartEmailAssistant solves this problem by embedding an AI-driven reply generator directly into Gmail.
When a user opens the Reply dialog in Gmail, a new AI Reply button appears next to the Send button. With a single click, the extension:
Reads the email content
Accepts a preferred tone (formal, professional, friendly, concise, etc.)
Sends this information to an AI service
Generates a well-structured reply instantly
Inserts the generated response into the reply editor
The user can review, edit, or send the email as-is.

# How It Works

Email Content Extraction
. The assistant automatically extracts the original email content when the reply dialog is opened.

AI-Powered Response Generation
